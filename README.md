## Introduction
Manim (Mathematical Animation Engine) is a powerful tool for creating animations that visually explain mathematical concepts. This repository contains various Manim scripts that I have developed to produce animations for educational purposes. These scripts are intended to help learners and educators create visually appealing and informative animations with Manim.

## Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the Manim scripts in this repository:

1. **Navigate to the Script Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/manim/scripts
   ```

2. **Run a Script**:
   - To render an animation in 4K quality, use the following command:
     ```bash
     manim -pqk your_script.py YourClassName
     ```
   - Replace `your_script.py` with the name of your script file and `YourClassName` with the name of the class containing the animation.

### Command Line Options
- `-pqk`: Render the scene in 4K quality and open the result.
- `-pl`: Render the scene with lower quality for faster preview.
